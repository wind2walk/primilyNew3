  Porting your number can be a tedious experience. To help you out, we put
  together a guide for everything you'll need to successfully port your number
  from the major carriers to Primity.


  Before porting a number into Primily, you'll need to do the following:

  Create a Primily account

  Choose a temporary Primily phone number


  **After the above steps have been completed, you can proceed to port a number
  in by navigating to your Settings > Number Porting.


  There are five basic types of information you will need to port your number
  into Primily: 

  - Name 

  - Account Number 

  - Billing Address

  - Telephone Number 

  - PIN 

  However, each provider requires slightly different information. To see what
  information you'll need for the porting process, click on your provider from
  the list below.

  Carrier account or contact their support department
